# Taliban Influence Over Afghanistan

The aim of the interactive map is to provide province wise taliban influence level across time along with general summary statistics. This map has been built as a part of the research project on the impact of the Taliban's influence and governance on women and child health outcomes.  This research project is for ECO-3650: Health Economics and supervised by Professor Aparajita Dasgupta. 

## Data

- The taliban influence level data for each province is sourced from FDD's Long War Journal.
- Province wise summary data is sourced from the Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2010 and 2015.
