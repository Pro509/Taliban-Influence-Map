# Mapping Taliban's Influence Over Afghanistan

The aim of the interactive map is to visualize province-wise Taliban influence levels across time. This map has been built as a part of the research project on the impact of the Taliban's influence and governance on women and child health outcomes.  This research project is for ECO-3650: Health Economics taught by Professor Aparajita Dasgupta. 

## Data

- The Taliban influence level data for each province is sourced from FDD's Long War Journal.
- Province-wise summary data is sourced from the Demographic and Health Survey conducted in the years 2010 and 2015.
